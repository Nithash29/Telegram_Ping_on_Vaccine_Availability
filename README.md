## Recommended Method: Anaconda
The Anaconda is an easily-installable bundle of Python and many of the libraries used throughout this class.
The script is written in python notebook (.ipynb). So, we recommend Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook for the run. If you wish to use any other software, feel free to do so.

### Anaconda Installation
1. Download the Anaconda from (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Follow the instructions on the above page to run the installer.
3. Check for python version: Start the `Anaconda Prompt` terminal, which you can find in the Start menu. On the Terminal type `python --version`, which outputs the version number. Kindly check python version is above 3.8.0.
4. Check whether Jupyter notebook is opening: Start the `Anaconda Prompt` terminal. Type `jupyter notebook`. A new browser window should open. 

## How to run the code
- Open the `Anaconda Prompt` terminal.
- Enter the command `cd !!location of the dowloaded/cloned file!!`. 
  As an example the command should look like this- `cd C:\Users\user_name\Downloads\Telegram_message_on_vaccine_availability`
- Install all the dependencies - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make changes into the main pyhton script before running. Check "Code Change Info" section for the same.
- Run the main script - `python CoWIN_Vaccine_Avail_Telegram.py`

## Code Change Info
- For sections where there is such link 'https://api.telegram.org/your_generated_bot_token/sendMessage?chat_id=your_chat_id&text="Your Message"' (basically line no. 236 and 240) check this link `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps1yeWwd6iA&t=256s` to learn how to generate the `bot_token` and `chat_id`.

## Additional info
- You can automate this task through `Task Scheduler`(available in Windows) to run after fixed intervals. However, this process is subject to your host system to be up and connected to internet.
